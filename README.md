# pomodoroTimer

Pomodoro Technique (source: wikipedia)

The original technique has six steps:

Decide on the task to be done.
Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).[1]
Work on the task.
End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).[5]
If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
